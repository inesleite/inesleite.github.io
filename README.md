# Data science portfolio by InÃªs Leite

This portfolio is a compilation of notebooks which I created for data analysis or for exploration of machine learning algorithms. A separate category is for separate projects.

## Stand-alone projects.

### Credit Decision Model

Build a credit model to predict future unpayments.

The training dataset contains the history of loan requests (orders) of a set of customers, as well as when they paid. The test dataset, contains the details of the last transaction requested by some of these users. The goal is to estimate the likelihood of the customers not paying it. 

The code can be found [here](https://github.com/inesleite/credit-decision-model).[nbviewer](https://nbviewer.org/github/inesleite/credit-decision-model/blob/main/solution.ipynb)


## Kaggle competitions.

### Avito demand prediction

[Avito demand prediction](https://www.kaggle.com/c/avito-demand-prediction) was a competition on Kaggle where we tried to predict something like demand based on ads content. This competition was very interesting because it had tabular data, texts and images. On the other hand this was the reason the competition was quite difficult. My team reached 131th place and got bronze medal! Here is a [link](https://github.com/Erlemar/Avito_demand_prediction_2018) to my solution.

## Classification problems.
