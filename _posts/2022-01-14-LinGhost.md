- This tool gives information about critical files which can be used for privilege escalation on linux/unix systems. It is heavily inspired by `Linpease` but more simple and intended to do CTF challenges like HackTheBox, TryHackme etc.

- I used the methods of `HackTricks`(https://book.hacktricks.xyz/linux-unix/privilege-escalation) and tried to keep this as simple as possible and beginner friendly.

##### P.S. This is not a Linpease alternative. It's for fun and CTF purpose only.
