Hey there! I am Inês Leite and I dabble in data science projects .

I work as a Data Scientist at [Onfido](https://www.onfido.com). 

In the past, I have worked as data scientist at a e-commerce called [Farfetch](https://www.farfetch.com/). 

In all of these roles, I worked extensively on Python (yes, you can probably see a common theme here!).

You can find me at the following places but the most reliable way to reach me is to send an email.
